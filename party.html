        I'm going out of town for a while on Friday so I want to make sure I know as much as possible before I leave<br>
        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>
            Arrive between 8:30 PM - 9:00 PM<br>
            Powerpoints start at 9:00 PM<br>
            You must be present @ 9:00 PM to qualify for prizes and voting<br>
            1 Person Per Powerpoint<br>
            Make powerpoints about 3-8 minutes long
